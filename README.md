# Datasprint 2019 notebooks
This repository contains Notebooks for exploration, visualisation and processing of data for Datasprint 2019 at the Royal Danish Library.

## Setup
Download the repository and make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) installed.

Once you have installed Python, unzip the downloaded folder, open a terminal/command prompt window and navigate to the unzipped folder. Then run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

**Note**: On Windows you may need to use `pip` instead of `pip3` in the command above if `pip3` is not recognised.

When the depencies are installed you can start Jupyter by running the command:

`jupyter notebook`

Jupyter launches a file manager in a browser window. From there you can open any of the Notebooks (characterised by the `.ipynb` file ending).
